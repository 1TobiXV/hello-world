# hello-world
This is my first repository
This is also my first time using Github, whilst being a student in the University of Greenwich. My favourite things to do is to play videogames and play lots of music.

Update (20-04-2023): I hope to upload my projects here and see where it takes me. I graduated July 2022 with a 2:1 in BSc Computing currently in employment under a zero-hour contract.
